<h1>Deploying ML Systems in Production</h1>
<p>
Real-life production ML systems operate autonomously, reacting to new data and events automatically. Besides indvidual
workflows, <a href="#">Metaflow allows you to build advanced reactive ML systems</a>. For instance, you can trigger
a workflow whenever new data is available:

<p>
The notebook on the left allows you to test event triggering. It guides you to deploy a simple workflow to
<a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/production/introduction">a production orchestrator supported by Metaflow, Argo
Workflows</a>. You can then trigger production runs through events that are created programmatically and observe
flow execution on the Argo Workflows UI and the Metaflow UI.</p>

  Follow instructions in the notebook to deploy a workflow in production and execute it through events. Access UIs by
  clicking the circles on the left navigation bar.
